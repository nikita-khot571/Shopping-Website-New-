# Login and Admin Page Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed showLoading function in login.html to properly show/hide loading spinner instead of trying to redirect with undefined `user` variable
- [x] Confirmed admin.html already has the fix for ReferenceError: user is not defined (window.user = user)

## Testing Tasks
- [ ] Test admin login with demo credentials (admin@shopzone.com / admin123)
- [ ] Test customer login with demo credentials (customer@shopzone.com / customer123)
- [ ] Verify admin page loads without errors after login
- [ ] Verify customer redirects to index.html after login
- [ ] Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Notes
- Server is running on localhost:4000 with GraphQL endpoint at /graphql
- Login mutation sends request to http://localhost:4000/graphql
- Admin page uses relative URLs for GraphQL calls (/graphql)
- Both login and admin pages store auth data in localStorage
